# Astrology Message Generator ðŸŒŒâœ¨

## Description ##
The Astrology Message Generator is a simple program that provides a fun, random astrology forecast. Each time the program runs, it generates a unique message based on a randomly selected zodiac sign, a theme (e.g., love, career, health), and a piece of advice.

## Project Objectives ##
This project was created to achieve the following learning objectives:

1) Practice Javascript: Develop a program using JavaScript to output random messages.
2) Use Git for Version Control: Practice using Git to track changes and manage code repositories.
3) Leverage the Command Line: Perform essential tasks such as running the program, committing changes, and pushing code using the terminal.
4) Develop Locally: Set up, build, and test the program on a local development environment.

## How It Works ##

The program uses three arrays:

* Zodiac Signs: Contains all 12 zodiac signs.
* Themes: Covers various aspects of life, such as love, career, and health.
* Advice: Offers insightful or motivational guidance.
* A random element is selected from each array and combined into a cohesive message.
